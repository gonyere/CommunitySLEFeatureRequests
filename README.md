# Welcome to Community SLE Feature requests

This repository is expected to develop into nice asciidoc/daps generated handbook which can be
then used as a guidance to openSUSE Community and SUSE partners interested in openSUSE Leap.

The most interesting part is currently [content workflow diagram for Jump].(https://github.com/openSUSE/CommunitySLEFeatureRequests/blob/master/images/svg/openSUSE-jump-content-workflow.svg)

Handbook will then replace https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap/SLEFeatureRequests
