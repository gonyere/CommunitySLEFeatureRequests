This article will give you a view from the contributor perspective on openSUSE Leap. Many of the concepts, commands to execute, people to talk to and so on are very similar to [[Portal:Factory|openSUSE Factory]]. We recommend to use the [[openSUSE:How_to_contribute_to_Factory|How to Contribute to openSUSE Factory]] guide as a starting point, with this guide focusing on the differences specific to [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]]. This article will guide you through contributing to roughly 4000 openSUSE Leap packages which come from SUSE Linux Enterprise''.


== Who is the audience?

Both community and SUSE-internal contributors to [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] who somehow need a change in one of packages which comes from SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE). '''Please see an effort to capture these [[Portal:Leap/SLEFeatureRequests:Personas | personas]].''' [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] contains roughly 4000 such packages with SLE origin as of today.

[[openSUSE:Release_team | openSUSE Release team]] is here to help you in this regard.


== Is this a new thing?

This is not new to [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]]. It has always been the case. We're just getting it formalized with the goal of making it easier and smoother over time.
This is independent from [[Portal:Leap/FAQ/ClosingTheLeapGap | Closing the Leap Gap]] proposal or [[Portal:Leap:Jump | the Jump prototype ]] for a next release of openSUSE Leap.


== Typical cases of SLE Feature requests

Please see our [[Portal:Leap/SLEFeatureRequests:Personas | SLE Feature Request personas]] to have a better understanding, as most of community SLE Feature requests are in fact [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] requests.


== What about regular bugs?

Regular bugs are not in the scope of this process. 

Please follow [[openSUSE:Submitting_bug_reports]] on how to submit a bug report. 
We'll be more than happy if you'll link the Factory submit request to the bug.

In most cases the final Submit Request (SR) will come from the SLE side and will then supersede any open [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] SR against the package. Please keep this in mind.


== How do I find package origin?

Use osc origin (zypper in osc-plugin-origin) to check where the package comes from. 
Packages which are subject to this process are those with origin SUSE:SLE*.  


{{Shell|linux:~> osc origin -p openSUSE:Leap:15.2 package bash # SLE origin
<br>SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:GA}}

{{Shell|linux:~> osc origin -p openSUSE:Leap:15.2 package tmux # Factory origin
<br>openSUSE:Factory}}

{{Shell|linux:~> osc origin -p openSUSE:Leap:15.2 package kdelibs4 # Origin is Leap updates
<br>openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update}}


== How can I create an SLE Feature Request?

* '''Create a Submit Request against [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]]'''.

First of all please keep in mind that we all need to respect openSUSE:Factory_development_model, so make sure that it was submitted to Factory as well. This also contributes to having the feature request processed more quickly.

The Release Manager(s) and Release Engineer(s) will process the request and create an SLE Feature requests in [https://jira.suse.com JIRA] and request approvals. Submit Request will be linked to the feature request.

Having an SR available significantly speeds up the process even though the SR against [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] is expected to be rejected in the end as the change comes via SLE.

* '''Create a bug report against openSUSE Distribution'''.

The Release Manager(s) process all bugs with no priority set (default P5 priority) and transform obvious Feature requests into SLE feature requests in [https://jira.suse.com JIRA]. 

If applicable you can reference a Submit Request against Factory or even a rejected Submit Request against [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]]. Please be aware that requests should respect the criteria for upcoming milestone. For example, if you submit a brand new feature request in RC or post-RC phase it will be most likely rejected or deferred to a next release.

* '''Reach out to [[openSUSE:Release_team]] on irc'''
Preferably Release Manager for [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] on irc / #opensuse-factory for more guidance. 
Do not use simply file request via plain email.


== How do I get updates about the progress?

We do currently provide a weekly updates on all SLE Community feature requests as part of [https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/ReleaseEngineering-meeting|openSUSE Release Engineering Meeting Minutes]. Minutes are also sent each Wednesday to opensuse-factory@ right after the meeting.

Unfortunately, there is currently no way to see updates from JIRA for non-SUSE people.
This should change by autumn 2020, when we expect to have a proper process in place.

The request for a transparent process is already in place (JIRA-722 - SLE feature process for external [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] Contributors).


'''Currently, the best way is to watch meeting minutes or ask Release Manager or Release Engineer for an update. See [[openSUSE:Release_team|openSUSE Release team]] for more information.'''


==What does "Change has to come from SLE" mean?

The current [[Portal:Leap|openSUSE Leap]] workflow receives an automatic submission from SUSE Linux Enterprise as soon as it's accepted in SLE.

The [[Portal:Leap:Jump]] workflow will simply sync the SLE binary containing the change as soon as it is built.
